Being new in cyber security can be struggle, you might not know where to start or what to learn. My primary purpose of writing this post, is to provide you information so that you can get started today! When I first started learning cyber security, it took me sometime to realize what I needed to learn or where to start.
Overview:
I will try to keep this short and simple. Having a good starting point, will help you break into cyber security in greater depth. In this post I will talk about certifications , college, being self taught. My goal here is to provide you details on the things you will need and it depends on which area you want to dive straight into. I am currently learning to advance myself. I decided to share the resources I know to help others.
Beginner self taught resources:
CompTIA A+, Network +, Security +, Cloud, Microsoft, Linux, Virtualization, ITIL V4, will help you understand the fundamentals of the computer hardware, network, security, cloud, etc. Once you get a understanding of those aspects, you can move on to something you are interested in, it could be forensics, reverse engineering, etc.
A+: If you want to learn the fundamentals of computer hardware this is a great place to start, I would recommend courses from Mike Meyers on Udemy, also Jason Dion has great content, there is books you can purchase from mike Meyers, also Power Cert Animated Videos has some great videos on YouTube, some things on PowerCert videos will be outdated but great amount of resourceful knowledge, go with the resources that you are most comfortable with.

Networking: Getting started learning the network of the world, some great people I respect and the content they provide will help you learn and be motivated. Starting with fundamentals I would recommend going with Mike Meyers, he has his own website website or you can buy his network + courses on Udemy for $10 on sale. You can move onto more advanced concept like someone I respect David Bombal has great CCNA course you can do, it will teach you how to configure router and switch more in depth than the network + course, also David Bombal gives away a lot of his courses for free. Network Chuck from YouTube has great free networking videos that he posts as often as he can. Certbros has some great explanation videos that I have found and would recommend.
